    <h1>Suede - Love the way you love</h1>
    <p>
        I love the way you love love me baby love the way you love love me baby love the way you love me baby</p>
    <p>I watch the sky and I watch the rain I count the drops dripping down the drain takes 30 seconds to talk about my day</p>
    <p>I sit and watch you on a video screen your legs and faces in a magazine your endless places so endlessly obscene</p>
    <p>I change the channels and rot my mind
I fantasise that you're really mine
I step into the page and feel alive</p>
    <p>I analyse our relationship
I count the cost of the broken bits
I'd call you up but I don't know where you live</p>
    <p>I love the way you love me baby
love the way you love me baby
love the way you love me baby</p>
